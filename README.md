- Create a project with some constraints listed in the python notebook file
- Connect your cloud database to mongodb compass and import the restaurants.json to your database
- Each of the exercises has 2 cells:
    + Write your query in pymongo and run in the FIRST cell
    + Don't run the SECOND cell because it contains the results for you to compare with your results
